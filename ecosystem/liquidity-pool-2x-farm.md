# ðŸ’° Liquidity Pool 2x Farm

LP Farm lets you earn passive income by locking your tokens into a "pool". It requires you to have special tokens called LP tokens which are the tokens you obtain after you provided liquidity for a certain token pair on a dex, in this case for MartinB/BCH pair on TangoSwap. You, in return, after successfully locking or staking your LP tokens will earn 2 different tokens which are MartinB and Tango.
