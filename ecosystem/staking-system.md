![](../.gitbook/assets/RushDApp-Roadmap.jpg)

### There are 4 phases in the roadmap.

#### The 1st phase includes

* Minting of Jeepney Rush which is currently ongoing
* Staking - already deployed, you can stake any SEP712 NFTs regardless of it being abandoned or is currently active.
  * Initial Earning Rates:
    * Jeepney Rush - 100 Oil per day
    * All other NFTs - 25 Oil per day
* Nitro Boost - minted/bought with Crude Oil or other tokens such as MartinB, Knuth, ARG, TANGO. It is used to boost your rewards and enable NFT staking.
  * Different Nitro Boosts also have different effects on your staking, your reward multiplier and its duration or validity period depends on the token you used to mint Nitro Boost.
    * Reward rates based on type of Nitro:

| Nitro Type   | Price                 | Multiplier |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ---------- |
| Nitro CRUDE  | 700 Oil               | 2x         |
| Nitro MARTIN | 8,181,050,000 MartinB | 2.1x       |
| Nitro KTH    | 58, 821 KTH           | 2.2x       |
| Nitro ARG    | 112, 126, 000 ARG     | 2.2x       |
| Nitro TANGO  | 133.77 TANGO          | 2.3x       |

#### 2nd phase includes

Other NFT Staking. NitroBoost is required so you can stake and start earning, especially on the rugged NFT projects.

* Equipping of Nitro can be optional if the project owner requests or demands it.
* The project owner can pay or be provided with a rewarder address so they can send their own token as an alternative reward aside from Crude Oil. It‚Äôs called ‚Äústaking-asa- service‚Äù.
* You don‚Äôt have to mint Nitro to staked Jeepney Rush and CryptoBug NFTs. If you equip them with Nitro, your reward rate will be boosted.

It is important to take note that Jeepney Rush and CryptoBug (all Rush NFTs) don't need Nitro so when you stake it, you automatically earn, equipping it with Nitro is optional. If you use Nitro for your JEEPs, it increases your reward rate instead. Nonjeepney Rush NFTs require Nitro so to start earning you have to mint 1 each for 1 NFT.

Also Nitro has a validity period of one week so you have to monitor your Nitroequip. You must claim or unstake your NFT before the Nitro expires. Else earnings will reset to zero.

The star emoji indicates that the staked NFT has a Nitro equipped, and it will also glows (depending on the NitroType)

The Staking Vault rewards is a dynamic table, meaning if someone stakes their NFT and the contract sees it as a new collection, it will automatically be added to the list. The x2.30 is the total multiplier, the level of the staked NFT and its equipped Nitro power.

RushDApp has a special feature where whenever an NFT is equipped with Nitro, it will gain experience just like an RPG character, and when its experience reaches 300, it will become 1 level higher which means additional multiplier. However, the experience gauge is not yet displayed, soon it will be included on the NFTCard for easy reference.

There‚Äôs actually a trick for fast leveling. If you equipped an NFT with Nitro and staked it, it gains 1 level and if you unstaked, you get the NFT back and get your rewards. Then if you stake the same NFT again, the level will be the same since last equipped, but if you equipped it with Nitro, it will gain experience and level up. If you do these things multiple times your NFT will eventually reach a high level (max level that can be attain at the moment is 10) and bigger multiplier thus, higher earning rate.

Double equipping of Nitro might cause gas fee error so if you want to mint another Nitro for the same NFT (maybe because you want it to level up) you need to either unstaked it first or wait for it to expire.

RushDApp has a mini feature where you can transfer or send your NFTs to another wallet. You can use it as an alternative for Oasis Marketplace.
