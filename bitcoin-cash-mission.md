# â›³ Bitcoin Cash Mission

The mission of Bitcoin Cash is to become the world's preferred currency - a borderless, immutable, uncensorable, fast, quick, affordable, and reliable payment method which can be used for worldwide everyday commerce by every human and every machine.&#x20;

The mission is to be a true peer-to-peer electronic cash system which makes financial services accessible to everybody - also to those who haven't had them.&#x20;

Bitcoin Cash wants to bank the unbanked - all the while removing the need for middlemen. Bitcoin Cash wants to give the people the power over their own money.
