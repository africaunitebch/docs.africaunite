# ðŸ‘·â™‚ Keys to Achieving the Mission

To achieve the goal of Bitcoin Cash, three main driven tools should unitedly work together: Technology, Community and Adoption.

Every cryptocurrency needs good technology. In the case of Bitcoin Cash reliability, high performance and scalability are of the utmost importance for achieving the goal of becoming the world's preferred currency.

In case of Bitcoin Cash, the technology is developed by multiple development teams - such as the [Africa Unite](./) team. It is the technology that enables the community to further the adoption of the cryptocurrency. Without the developers, there is no technology. And without technology, there is no cryptocurrency. And of course, technology needs adoption. Without adoption even the best technology is useless. It needs users. And these users need to be onboarded by the community. Only when good technology meets adoption, the technology serves its purpose. It is a virtuous circle - or a symbiotic relationship.

Furthermore, the developers depend on the support from the community. This support has historically been given in the form of donations.
