# 🌐 Summary

The following quote by CHIBUOKE EMMY - the owner of the [Africa Unite](./) quote carved out from a song sang by the great Bob Marley and the Wailers 1992 titled Africa unite (the prophet in the African wilderness) gives an overview of the main idea behind the [<mark style="color:orange;">Martin₿</mark>](https://www.smartscan.cash/address/0x4ea4a00e15b9e8fee27eb6156a865525083e9f71) token and its mission

“A carrion call for unification of all”

“Africa Unite for family “

“Unite for country “

“Unite for children “

“Unite for the world “

I think [SmartBCH ](https://smartbch.org)is the tool for this great purpose which in turn will give BCH a big boost - and with unite from not just Africa but the entire world we can make miracle.

We also believe (some of the BCH supporters) that the launch of these tokens will help attract capital from other Blockchains such as ETH and BSC.
