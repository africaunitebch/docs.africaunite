# ðŸŽ‰ INTRODUCTION

Africa Unite BCH is an ecosystem built on SmartBCH, an EVM and Web3 compatible sidechain for Bitcoin Cash, to take advantage of smart contracts, low-cost fast transactions, and decentralization.&#x20;

Team has issued itâ€™s official SEP20 (stands for SmartBCH Expansion Proposal number 20) token called Africa Unite token (MartinB) that was created in April 2022 with a fixed supply and can be found at [0x4ea4a00e15b9e8fee27eb6156a865525083e9f71](https://www.smartscan.cash/address/0x4ea4a00e15b9e8fee27eb6156a865525083e9f71). Martinâ‚¿ will be the basis and foundation for raising awareness, connecting businesses and representing all BCH and SmartBCH projects as well as developing Martinâ‚¿ and unite Africa worldwide



### PROJECT VISION

[Martinâ‚¿](https://www.smartscan.cash/address/0x4ea4a00e15b9e8fee27eb6156a865525083e9f71) token was not made to be just a token but rather a clarion call. It will be the awakening to the world and to Africans both local and diaspora. Africa Unite BCH aims at preaching unification, human development/use case for other tokens, thus helping Bitcoin Cash towards its mission of becoming a peer to peer payment system.&#x20;

Our goal is to have a technology that will lead the community towards the adoption of cryptocurrency, to build a global presence that will help in promoting a United Africa and Bitcoin Cash. By using our token such as by holding, tipping, buying and selling, the community basically demonstrates support in Bitcoin Cash development.&#x20;

[Martinâ‚¿](https://www.smartscan.cash/address/0x4ea4a00e15b9e8fee27eb6156a865525083e9f71) will also provide room for community building and project growth as well in supporting its developers by â€“ aside from sending donations â€“ buying [Martinâ‚¿](https://www.smartscan.cash/address/0x4ea4a00e15b9e8fee27eb6156a865525083e9f71) tokens. It is also part of our vision to give financial assistance and/or invest into other projects in the BCH ecosystem if our funding support allows us.
